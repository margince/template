# gitleaks-pin.sh — the pinned secret scanner, resolved the same way everywhere.
#
# Sourced by scripts/secret-scan.sh and scripts/secret-scan.test.sh. It does not
# scan anything itself; it hands back the path to ONE known binary.
#
# The scanner is fetched and checksum-verified rather than taken from PATH. A
# secret scan's verdict is a function of its rule set, so "some gitleaks" on a
# laptop and a pinned one in CI are not the same gate — and the difference shows
# up as a finding that only appears after you push, or worse, only in CI's
# absence. Pinning here is what lets `make secret-scan` promise the answer the
# pull request will get. It also means no engineer has to install anything: the
# repo's own toolchain rule (see the SBOM lane's digest-pinned images).
#
# Bumping the version: change GITLEAKS_VERSION and replace all four digests
# from the release's checksums.txt. All four, not just yours — the others are
# what CI and your colleagues run.
#
# A COPY of core/scripts/gitleaks-pin.sh, deliberately rather than a delegation:
# this repository's scan is its own gate over its own commits, and a lane that
# reached into the submodule for its scanner would change version whenever the
# pointer moved. Keep the version in step with core's when convenient, but they
# are not required to agree — what must not drift is a digest and its version.
