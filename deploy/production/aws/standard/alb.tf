# ---- Access log bucket -------------------------------------------------------
# Shared by the ALB's own access logs (this file) and the blobstore bucket's
# server access logs (s3.tf), under separate prefixes — both destinations
# have the identical constraint (same region, same account, SSE-S3 only, not
# this stack's own CMK: ALB access logging documents this explicitly,
# docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/enable-access-logging.html,
# "The only server-side encryption option that's supported is Amazon
# S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)"; S3 server access logging's own doc gives the
# identical requirement), so one bucket serves both rather than standing up
# a second one to hold nothing but a different prefix. This is why this
# bucket uses AES256 while every other bucket in this stack uses this
# stack's own CMK — not an inconsistency, a constraint of the two services
# being logged.
