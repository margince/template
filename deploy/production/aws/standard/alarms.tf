# CPUCreditBalance alarms for the two burstable (T-family) instance types this
# stack defaults to — db.t4g.medium (rds.tf) and cache.t4g.small
# (elasticache.tf). Both accumulate credits at idle and can throttle under
# SUSTAINED load once the balance is exhausted; that throttling shows up as
# "the app got slow" with nothing else obviously wrong, unless something is
# watching the balance itself. Performance Insights/Enhanced Monitoring
# (rds.tf) and the slow-log export (elasticache.tf) tell you AFTER the fact
# that something was slow — these alarms are the one signal that fires BEFORE
# a burstable instance actually throttles.
#
# No subscription is created here — an operator's alert destination (email,
# Slack, PagerDuty) is theirs to own, the same reasoning this stack gives for
# every other operator-specific value it declines to pick on your behalf.
# Subscribe with:
#   aws sns subscribe --topic-arn "$(terraform output -raw alerts_topic_arn)" \
#     --protocol email --notification-endpoint you@example.com
#
# Every resource below is gated on var.enable_deep_monitoring (variables.tf),
# so this whole file is a no-op when it's false — the alarms, and the SNS
# topic they'd otherwise page into, simply don't exist rather than existing
# unsubscribed.
