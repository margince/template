# The blobstore client (backend/internal/platform/blobstore/s3.go) is a
# generic minio-go client authenticating with static keys — same reasoning
# as the full stack's own s3.tf for why this is an IAM user's access key,
# not the instance role, that satisfies MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_ACCESS_KEY/
# SECRET_KEY.
#
# This bucket also holds the one config object the full stack instead
# mounts via EFS: ${var.name_prefix}/margince.yaml — see ec2.tf's user-data,
# which fetches it at boot. No EFS in this stack: one instance has local
# disk, and EFS's entire value (shared mount across many tasks) buys
# nothing when there is only ever one.
