# Premium SKU is this stack's one deliberate cost increase over the cheapest

# supports a private endpoint (privateendpoints.tf). Basic/Standard ACR would
# make this the one public-endpoint exception in a stack that
# private-networks everything else.

  #     image_tag_mutability = IMMUTABLE on AWS. A locked tag refuses a
  #     re-push and a delete.

  #     policy on AWS), so the number of released images kept for rollback
  #     is bounded by hand.
